Security:
	* User logs in, and obtains a security token which expires with
	  the session. [Possible ?]
	* User gains priviledges analogous to the access level assigned to her
	  account. The level value is inversely proportional to the depth
	  of access the user has. Each action is assigned a level of access. 
	  Actions with a level higher or equal to a particular user's level are 
	  accessible to that user. All actions for which no definition of level
	  exists are by default assigned the level 0, and are only accessible to
	  the root account, which possesses that level.
